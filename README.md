Zarego Code Challenge - Kotlin version

In this project, I've used Cloud Firestore as the main DB. This library allows the user to make changes in the app even in offline mode; when the data changes, every change is kept in cache until the device is able to connect to the internet again. When the connection is restored, the Cloud Firestore updates all changes.

I've used FirestoreRecyclerAdapter (part of FirestoreUI library) as the extension for the list adapter instead of the regular RecyclerView Adapter, since that class allowed me to observe the DB in real time and to listen to changes to update the UI accordingly.

Even though there are methods that connect views directly with the DB (such as .snapshots, which, as a getter of the FirestoreRecyclerAdapter class, is called inside the Adapter and used to delete entries with side swipe), the rest of the interactions between views and models are done following the MVC architecture pattern.

The app allows the user to insert new entries with a FAB, to see the user detail by clicking the list element, to update/edit data from existing users, and to delete the user by side swiping the list element to the left.
